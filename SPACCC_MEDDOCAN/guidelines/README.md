# Guidelines

The annotation guidelines describe the criteria that have been followed to annotate the corpus, along with illustrative examples. 

The MEDDOCAN annotation scheme defines a total of 29 granular entity types grouped into more general parent classes. 

Guidelines have been written and developed in Spanish and are only available in Spanish.
